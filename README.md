## Coursework in stationary stochatic processes
You can find the laboratory exercises provided under pythonLab<Labnumber>

* __Lab1__:  Studying expected value, covariance function and spectral density for some process realization
* __Lab2__: Studying combination between pole-zero plots, covariance functions, spectral densities and realizations for AR-, MA and ARMA processes. 
* __Lab3__: Investigating concepts of leakage, resolution and variance for different periodogram-based spectral estimation techniques.
